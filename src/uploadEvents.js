 * to the queue's job events through Redis and emits them to the project room:
 *
 *   attachmentCreated (status 'processing', from the upload request)
 *     -> attachmentReady  | attachmentFailed   (from here)
 *
 * Each API instance forwards events to its own connected clients, so this
 * stays correct with more than one API process.
